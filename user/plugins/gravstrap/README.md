# Gravstrap Plugin

`Gravstrap` is a [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) plugin that gives you the ability to use Bootstrap elements in the Grav way. Each Bootstrap element can be defined both at site level and / or at page level. When you define the same element, the page overrides the site element.

The full ducumentation is available at the [developer's website](http://diblas.net/plugins/use-bootstrap-elements-in-the-grav-cms-way)
