title: Horizon vs. Merdian
---
OpenNMS is delivered as two different, completely open source, distributions: _**Meridian**_  and  _**Horizon**_. The source code for both distributions is exactly the same; however, the release cycle and the support options available vary for each.

OpenNMS _**Meridian**_ is a subscription service that provides access to an optimized and very stable version of OpenNMS that maximizes the platform’s value and minimizes the effort required to maintain it. OpenNMS Horizon is freely available to download and contains the newest features that are updated on a rapid release schedule. Features that have proven to be stable and effective in Horizon will eventually be merged into Meridian.

Following the “release early, release often” model, OpenNMS _**Horizon**_ contains all of the newest features developed for the platform. The OpenNMS community drives the development of Horizon along with The OpenNMS Group, one of the largest upstream contributors. Community members may contribute via [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) against the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms)

. _**Horizon**_ is licensed under the [Affero General Public License (AGPLv3)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License). 
_**Meridian**_ is licensed under the AGPLv3, the same as Horizon. Purchasing a subscription to Meridian will provide access to the Meridian binaries accompanied by the Meridian code. For organizations that have a policy against using software published under the AGPL, Meridian is also available under an optional proprietary license.

Meridian is initially offered via RPMs [Red Hat Enterprise Linux](http://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux) and [CentOS](http://www.centos.org/).
