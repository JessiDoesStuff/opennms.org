## Southbound Integration

Gather performance measurements and log messages from network applications and devices supporting industry standard management protocols.
Synthetic polling framework to test from IP stack over management agents to applications.

* IPv4 and IPv6 network reachability over ICMP
* Test generic TCP connection
* Test status and resources provided from management agents (SNMP, JMX, WMI, WS-Management, NRPE, NSClient++)
* Collect performance measurements from open protocols and management agents (SNMP, JMX, WMI, WS-Management, NSClient++, HTTP, XML, JSON, JDBC)
* Receive SNMP Traps and Syslog messages and convert to high-level alarms using correlation mechanisms
