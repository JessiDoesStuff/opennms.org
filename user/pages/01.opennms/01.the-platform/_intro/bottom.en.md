OpenNMS is an enterprise-grade, integrated, open-source platform to build network monitoring solutions.
Goals include accelerating time to production by supporting industry standard network management protocols, agents, and a programmable provisioning system.
The OpenNMS community helps to make interoperable network monitoring solutions.

An event-driven architecture allows flexible workflow integration in existing monitoring and management stacks.
OpenNMS normalizes device- and vendor-specific messages and protocol-specific performance measurements.
Based on open source technologies, the data are accessible through a powerful ReST API and can be used in high level management workflow applications.
