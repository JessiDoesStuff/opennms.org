The project divides documentation for persons with special use cases.
It is helpful to start with the *User Guide*.
He gives general insights how OpenNMS operates and concepts.
The *Administrator Guide* is specialized to build or change configuration of OpenNMS to implement new monitoring use cases or maintenance in general.
With the *Developer Guide* you get all information to change the OpenNMS source code.

This documentation is released and tight to specific OpenNMS versions and is part of the OpenNMS Source Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms/tree/develop/opennms-doc).
