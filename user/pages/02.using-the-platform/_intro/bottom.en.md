OpenNMS is a carrier-grade, integrated, open source platform to build network monitoring solutions.
Goals include accelerating time to production with supporting industry standard network management protocols, agents and a programmable provisioning system.
The OpenNMS community is helping to make interoperable network monitoring solutions.

An event-driven architecture allows flexibility workflow integration in existing monitoring and management stacks.
OpenNMS normalizes device and vendor specific messages and protocol specific performance measurements.
Based on open source technologies, the data are accessible through ReST API and can be used in high level management workflow application.
