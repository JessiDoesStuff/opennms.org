# Welcome to the OpenNMS Community

the place of the world’s first enterprise grade network management platform developed under the open source model.

The project is mainly driven by The OpenNMS Group, Inc. and an elected group of community contributors _OGP_.
The election happens through contribution to the project, patches to fix or improve the software, helping others in the community or during our conferences.
_OGP's_ and people from _The OpenNMS Group, Inc._ have commit access to the project where the software is released and distributed.
Most decisions will be made using a lazy consensus model.

## The OpenNMS Group

The OpenNMS Group, Inc. is currently the largest contributor of the project and provides a distribution of OpenNMS Meridian with professional support which is similar to Red Hats Enterprise Linux subscription.
Beside that they also develop new features through OpenNMS Horizon which is similar to Red Hats Fedora and free as in freedom.
The build and packaging infrastructure is also maintained and provided by the OpenNMS Group.

## Order of the Green Polo

The Order of the Green Polo (OGP) is the super secret brotherhood of developers of the OpenNMS Project.
You can recognize and OGP member by their good looks as well as their super-flashy, very coveted OpenNMS Green Polo.

> Back in fall of 2004, I wanted to find a way to recognize those people who make OpenNMS what it is, and to thank them in some fashion.
> Ever since the advent of "business casual" workplace attire, the "logo" polo shirt has become a fixture in IT departments around the world.
> We sell black and white polos with the OpenNMS logo on our web site.
> But this is much, much, much, different.
> These are "green" polos, very rare, and they will never be available for sale.
> Think of them as equivalent to winning The Masters golf tournament’s green jacket - only harder to get.
> In order to get one, all one has to do is give up all hope of having a life outside of OpenNMS, work long hours for free, and basically become a closed superhero, squashing bugs (or uncovering existence) in a single bound.
