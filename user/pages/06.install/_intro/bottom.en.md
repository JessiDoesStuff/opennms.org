Quickstart install scripts work for most small network environments and gets you quickly up to speed.
Test new configurations or just evaluate OpenNMS and [Grafana](http://grafana.org) with a pre-installed [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) basebox image with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).
If you want a more customized installation please go to our [installation guides](https://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/17.0.0/guide-install/guide-install.html).
