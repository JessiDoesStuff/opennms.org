## OpenNMS on Windows Server

![Windows installer](/images/windows-install.png)

Installation is done with a graphical installer which is available for the latest stable on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennms/files/OpenNMS/).
OpenNMS uses PostgreSQL and it ships his own graphical installer which can be found on the [PostgreSQL Download](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows) section.

To install on Windows follow the [installation guide](http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/17.0.0/guide-install/guide-install.html#gi-install-opennms-windows).
