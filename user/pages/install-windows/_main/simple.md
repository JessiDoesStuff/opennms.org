## OpenNMS on Windows Server

Installation on Windows is done by a graphical installer and is spearate packaged.
You can find the `standalone-opennms-installer-{version}.zip` for latest stable version of OpenNMS on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennms/files/OpenNMS/).
OpenNMS requires [Oracle Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and [PostgreSQL](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/pgdownload#windows) which have their own graphical installer.
The [installation guide](http://docs.opennms.org/opennms/releases/17.0.0/guide-install/guide-install.html#gi-install-opennms-windows) describes the setup procedure in detail.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Most people in the OpenNMS community run and develop OpenNMS on Linux.
If you want a better community support experience, please consider to run on Linux.
